# move through Commons files and cats
* all files and cats under cat
  -> need templates
* all of those with Template:Artwork or Category:Template:artwork possible or Template:Category definition: Object
  -> should get items on Wikidata
* all of those on Wikidata which are not linked by one of the items with inventory number and image
